Olympus represents my entire IT ecosystem

I wanted a way to indentify machines that was more personal than "Desktop-1" and "Laptop", so I thought to use Greek mythology.
Thankfully it's quite expansive, so it's very unlikely that I will run out.

## Goal

I want to be able to easily recreate any device should anything happen to it, or should I want to migrate to different hardware.
I also want to use it as a learning experience.

## Challenges

Some details about my setup can be made public. If anything, I would be happy if anyone was to be inspired by the setup.
However, some of the data is private. I want to be able to hide what should be hidden, but to do so in plain sight.

## The Pantheon

An entity could be a hardware machine, or it could be a VM. Doesn't matter.

### Dionysus

The god of entertainment, and the source for any Linux ISOs.
